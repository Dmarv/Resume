I added the project pdf for each for the details of each project but here I will write an overview of each.

Project 2a,b
"""
This project was about video and audio compression using Haar matrices. This involved generating a haar matrix for input N. 
Performing the matrix multiplication, deleting some part of that matrix and then inverting it back again. It works because
the haar matrix groups all the low and high sounds/pixels together. 
We did this for 1d and 2d arrays. Meaning, we could compress both sound and images.
"""

Project 3
"""
I did not include project 1 because this contains that work within it. This project focused on spline interpolation or generating 
curves from points. 
"""

Project 4
"""
Here we did classification with Support vector machines. I have since learned much more about this technique and how we can use
the kernel technique to lift it into higher space to find non-linear separations. Sadly, it does suffer from the curse of dimensionality. 
"""
Project 5
"""
Here I used simple ridge regression. Since then, I've learned much more about regression and Linear algebra.
