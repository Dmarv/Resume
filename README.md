#homework 2:
"""This python projects is taken from homework. This project focused on solving simple problems such as n_queens, 
lights out and linear disk movement problems. It involved creating a space, generation next moves, find the valid 
moves of those moves.The main solutions used recursion as each step in the process shared form with the next step 
and the technique has backtracking baked into it. """

#homework 3
""" 
This project was about searching spaces efficiently and involved two parts. 
The first was finding a general solution to the sliding grid problem using heuristics like manhattan distance. 
The second part was finding shortest paths over a grid with walls using a-star which also uses heuristics.  
"""
#homework 4
"""
This project was a tiling problem called the domino problem. It makes use of function that find all valid moves
and gets the next best one similar to the previous projects. This one differs in that I made use of alpha beta pruning
in the recursion tree to limit the search space. 
"""

#homework 5
"""
Here I solved the sudoku problem with classic constrain satisfaction algorithms like ac3. It tested my ability to properly make 
a recursive function that backtracks. I added some "guessing" to solve harder sudoku problems which cannot be solved with pure constraints.
