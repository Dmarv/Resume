""" 
This python projects is taken from homework. It demonstrate a general understanding of Python.

#homework 2:
"""This project focused on solving simple problems such as n_queens, lights out and linear disk movement problems. 
It involved creating a space, generation next moves, find the valid moves of those moves. The main solutions used 
recursion as each step in the process shared form with the next step and the technique has backtracking baked into it. 
"""

#homework 3
""" 
This project was about searching spaces efficiently and involved two parts. 
The first was finding a general solution to the sliding grid problem using heuristics like Manhattan distance. 
The second part was finding shortest paths over a grid with walls using a-star which also uses heuristics.  
"""
#homework 4
"""
This project was a tiling problem called the domino problem. It makes use of function that find all valid moves
and gets the next best one similar to the previous projects. This one differs in that I made use of alpha beta pruning
in the recursion tree to limit the search space. 
"""

#homework 5
"""
Here, I solved the sudoku problem with classic constrain satisfaction algorithms like ac3. It tested my ability to properly make 
a recursive function that backtracks. I added some "guessing" to solve harder sudoku problems which cannot be solved with pure constraints.
"""

#homework 7
"""
I did not include this since it had a lot animations that we not my own code to display the results. It was a project on reinforcement learning. 
 It used bays nets to solve the pacman and navigation problems. It would run simulations with a learning agent and would reward him for succeding 
 and punish him for failing. I would update the probabilties as needed using bayes nets. 
"""

#homework 8
"""
Here, I used Markov decision models to generate predictive text. I generated a "fake" book based off of Frankenstein. I used techniques like
N-gram models (with padding) to find the probability a certain word would follow given the context or previous works. This was Markovâ€™s observation -
The past is independent of the future given the present. 
"""

#homework 9
"""
This was a soft introduction to categorical analysis using Perceptrons. Since this project I've studied many more techniques and have much better understanding
of logistic regression and other categorical analysis techniques.
